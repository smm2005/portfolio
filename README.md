# About This Project

My personal website provides information on who I am, what my skills and projects are as well as other miscellaneous information (contact page).
Note that this personal website is not quite done yet as I am fixing up more little details that exist in the portfolio website. This website is hosted on Netlify, with the following link: https://suhailmoeen.netlify.app/

The tools that I used are as follows:

- Front-end: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- Back-end: JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js
- Version control, CI/CD and hosting: Git, Netlify CLI
